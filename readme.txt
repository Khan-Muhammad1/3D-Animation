# Real-Time 3D Animation

## Project Description

This project features a real-time 3D animated scene of two cars driving towards each other in a city environment. The cars collide and create an explosion effect. The scene uses hierarchical models, custom shaders, procedural textures, and a 360-degree camera fly-around.
## Features

- Two cars modeled with hierarchical parts, animated to drive and collide  
- Explosion effect created using custom shaders  
- Procedural textures applied to city and vehicles  
- 360Â° camera fly-around showing the scene from all angles
